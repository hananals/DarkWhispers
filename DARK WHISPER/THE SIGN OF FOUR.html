        <p>It was a quiet evening at 221B Baker Street when the brilliant yet restless Sherlock Holmes was indulging in his violin. Dr. Watson, his loyal companion, watched with concern, knowing that only a thrilling case could draw Holmes out of his melancholia. Their answer came in the form of Miss Mary Morstan, a poised young woman with a peculiar mystery.</p>
        <p>Miss Morstan explained that her father, Captain Arthur Morstan, had disappeared a decade ago after returning to London from India. Since then, a series of events had left her perplexed: for six years, she had been receiving a valuable pearl every year, accompanied by anonymous letters. Now, she had been summoned to a mysterious meeting that promised to reveal the truth about her father. </p>
        <p>Holmes, intrigued, agreed to accompany Miss Morstan with Watson by his side.</p>
        <p>The meeting led them to Thaddeus Sholto, a nervous and eccentric man who revealed shocking news: Captain Morstan had died in a heated argument with Thaddeus’s father, Major Sholto, over a hidden treasure. The Major, wracked with guilt, confessed the truth on his deathbed but revealed no location for the treasure.
        </p>
        <p>However, Thaddeus believed the treasure had finally been found. He invited them to his brother Bartholomew’s home to share the discovery. Upon arriving, the group encountered a grim scene—Bartholomew had been murdered, and the treasure was missing. The only clue left behind was a small thorn and a cryptic message: The Sign of the Four.</p>
        <p>Holmes sprang into action, piecing together the puzzle with his razor-sharp intellect. He deduced that the murder and theft were the work of two culprits: Jonathan Small, a one-legged man, and his accomplice, a mysterious figure from the Andaman Islands.</p>
        <p>Through chemical analyses, interviews, and the tracking skills of Toby the dog, Holmes uncovered the duo’s escape route. The case culminated in a dramatic chase along the River Thames. A police boat, with Holmes and Watson aboard, pursued Small’s steam launch. After a thrilling pursuit, Small was captured, though his accomplice perished in the river.‍
        </p>
        <p>In custody, Jonathan Small revealed the origins of the treasure. He was once a soldier in India, where he joined forces with three others to seize a vast fortune of jewels. Their betrayal led to imprisonment, but Small made a pact with Major Sholto to retrieve the treasure in exchange for his freedom. Sholto betrayed him, claiming the treasure as his own. Small’s vengeance brought him to London, but his efforts ended in failure.</p>
        <p>Despite the capture of the culprits, the story took an unexpected turn. The treasure chest, when opened, was empty—its contents had been thrown into the Thames by Small in a final act of defiance.</p>
        <p>For Miss Morstan, the loss of the treasure mattered little. Watson, captivated by her kindness and courage, confessed his feelings. The case ended not with wealth, but with love and companionship, leaving Holmes to retreat to his solitude and the comfort of his violin.</p>
