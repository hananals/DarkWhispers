    <div class="content">
        <p>In the quiet English village of King’s Abbot, life seemed peaceful, but beneath its serene surface lay secrets and scandals waiting to unravel. Dr. James Sheppard, the village doctor, lived a predictable life, spending his days tending to his patients and his evenings fending off the gossip of his curious sister, Caroline. Their routine was shattered when tragedy struck.</p>
        <p>Roger Ackroyd, a wealthy and respected resident, was found murdered in his study. The crime sent shockwaves through the village, especially since Ackroyd had been deeply distressed the night before. He had confided in Dr. Sheppard that he had received a letter revealing the identity of a blackmailer tormenting his late fiancée, Mrs. Ferrars, who had recently died under mysterious circumstances</p>
        <p>The letter, however, disappeared, leaving no clue as to the blackmailer’s identity.</p>
        <p>The local police struggled with the case, and it seemed destined to remain unsolved. Enter Hercule Poirot, the retired Belgian detective, who had recently moved to the village to cultivate vegetable marrows. Persuaded by Ackroyd’s niece, Flora, Poirot took up the case, determined to uncover the truth.</p>
        <p>With his keen mind and sharp wit, Poirot began his investigation. The household and its inhabitants quickly came under scrutiny. Flora, Ackroyd’s charming niece, had something to hide. Major Blunt, the stoic family friend, seemed to harbor unspoken feelings. Geoffrey Raymond, Ackroyd’s secretary, was oddly defensive, and Parker, the butler, acted suspiciously.</p>
        <p>As Poirot delved deeper, it became evident that nearly everyone in the household had a motive. Ackroyd’s wealth and the reading of his will added fuel to the fire. Poirot discovered a series of mysterious events on the night of the murder—a stranger seen at the gate, unusual phone calls, and alibis that didn’t quite align</p>
        <p>Dr. Sheppard, ever the loyal narrator, assisted Poirot but found himself puzzled by the detective’s eccentric methods. Poirot’s famous declaration, “It is not just the facts, but the psychology that will reveal the truth,” seemed cryptic yet tantalizing.</p>
        <p>Poirot’s investigation culminated in a dramatic gathering of the suspects. With his usual flair, Poirot laid out the evidence, peeling back layers of deception. The blackmailer, the mysterious stranger, and the timeline of events all came into focus.</p>
        <p>Then came the unthinkable twist: the murderer was none other than Dr. Sheppard himself, the very narrator of the tale.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sheppard had been the blackmailer, exploiting Mrs. Ferrars’ guilt over her husband’s death. When she threatened to reveal the truth to Ackroyd, Sheppard killed Ackroyd to silence him and fabricated his alibi through his narration. The missing letter, the misleading phone call—it had all been orchestrated by him.‍
        </p>
        <P>Poirot, while exposing Sheppard, offered him a chance to preserve his dignity. Rather than face a public trial, Sheppard could take his own life, sparing his sister and the village further scandal. In his final journal entry, Dr. Sheppard confessed to his crimes, leaving behind a chilling legacy as one of the most shocking narrators in detective fiction.</P>
