    <div class="content">
        <p>Hercule Poirot, the brilliant and meticulous Belgian detective, had just settled into a quiet retirement when he received a strange letter. Written in bold, taunting tones, the letter challenged Poirot to stop a series of murders. The signature? A.B.C.</p>
        <p>The letter included the date and location of the first crime: Andover, a small market town. True to the letter’s promise, Mrs. Ascher, a humble tobacconist, was found murdered in her shop, with an A.B.C. Railway Guide left nearby. Poirot’s reputation was now on the line.</p>
        <p>Before Poirot could make sense of the first crime, another letter arrived. This time, the killer warned of a murder in Bexhill. When Betty Barnard, a carefree waitress, was strangled on the beach, another A.B.C. guide was left at the scene. Poirot noted the pattern: the killer was following the alphabet, targeting victims in alphabetical order by their names and locations.</p>
        <p>The public was in a frenzy. Was it the work of a madman, or was there a sinister logic behind the chaos? Poirot, undeterred, focused on the psychology of the killer, insisting, “It is method, not madness, that we are dealing with.”‍</p>
        <p>The third murder occurred in Churston, where Sir Carmichael Clarke, a wealthy man, was struck down in his garden. The alphabet pattern was clear, but something about the victim seemed off. Why target a prominent man after two relatively ordinary people? Poirot grew increasingly suspicious.</p>
        <p>The killer’s letters continued, taunting Poirot and the police. Yet Poirot noticed inconsistencies in the style of writing, suggesting a deliberate attempt to mislead.</p>
        <p>The turning point came when Poirot interviewed Alexander Bonaparte Cust, a timid traveling salesman with epilepsy. Cust seemed an unlikely suspect, but circumstantial evidence mounted against him. He had been in the vicinity of each murder, carried an A.B.C. guide, and sold stockings to Betty Barnard shortly before her death. Cust, bewildered and confused, couldn’t account for his actions, further incriminating himself.</p>
        <p>Yet Poirot was not convinced. His little grey cells told him there was a deeper plot. “What is the motive?” he pondered. “Where is the personal connection?”.</p>
        <p>In a dramatic reveal, Poirot gathered the key players and exposed the truth: Cust was innocent, a mere pawn in the real killer’s plan. The true murderer was Franklin Clarke, the brother of Sir Carmichael Clarke.</p>
        <p>Franklin had masterminded the alphabet scheme to mask his true motive: killing his brother for inheritance. By making Sir Carmichael’s murder appear as part of a random series, Franklin hoped to divert suspicion. He manipulated Cust, planting evidence and orchestrating the crimes to fit the pattern.‍</p>
        <P>Poirot’s brilliance lay in seeing the psychological underpinnings of the crime. Why would a madman follow a predictable pattern? Only someone with a logical goal could devise such a scheme.</P>
        <p>With Clarke arrested and Cust exonerated, Poirot’s reputation soared once again. Reflecting on the case, Poirot remarked, “It is order that triumphs over chaos, mon ami. Even in the mind of a murderer.”‍</p>
