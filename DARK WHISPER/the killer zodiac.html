    <div class="content">
        <P>San Francisco, late 1960s. The city buzzed with counterculture movements, music festivals, and protests. But in the shadows, a sinister presence stalked the streets. They called him the Zodiac Killer—a name etched into the collective memory of terror, confusion, and obsession.</P>
        <P>The first known attack happened on a quiet summer evening in July 1968. A young couple, Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday, were parked on a remote lover’s lane when an unknown assailant approached. Without warning, the night erupted in violence. The killer left no clues, just two lifeless bodies and a growing fear that something darker was lurking in California's picturesque suburbs.‍</P>
        <P>Months later, a letter arrived at the San Francisco Chronicle, one of three sent to local newspapers. The letters were chilling. Written in a cipher, they demanded publication or promised further bloodshed. The killer claimed responsibility for the murders and introduced himself: Zodiac.</P>
        <P>“I like killing people,” he wrote. “It’s so much fun. More fun than hunting wild game in the forest.”‍</P>
        <P>The city was gripped with paranoia. Police struggled to crack the cipher, while reporters debated the ethics of giving a killer the attention he craved. One letter revealed part of the Zodiac’s twisted motivation: a belief that his victims would become his “slaves” in the afterlife.</P>
        <P>Over the next few months, Zodiac struck again.‍</P>
        <P>In September 1969, Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard were relaxing by Lake Berryessa when Zodiac appeared, wearing a hood emblazoned with his symbol: a crosshair. He tied them up, stabbed them repeatedly, and left a chilling message on their car door:‍
           <br> “By knife, by gun, by fire, by rope.”‍
            <br>Cecelia succumbed to her wounds, but Bryan survived, becoming one of the few to live to tell the tale.
        </P>
        <P>Just weeks later, Zodiac killed cab driver Paul Stine in the heart of San Francisco. He boldly tore a piece of Stine’s bloody shirt and mailed it to the police, taunting them with their inability to stop him.</P>
        <P>One of Zodiac’s ciphers, consisting of 408 symbols, was finally cracked by a high school teacher and his wife. The solution revealed his chilling thoughts but no clear identity:‍
            “I will not give you my name because you will try to slow me down or stop my collecting of slaves for my afterlife.”</P>
        <P>Despite the breakthrough, the mystery deepened. Zodiac seemed to be everywhere and nowhere. Witness descriptions were inconsistent—a stocky man with glasses, a shadow in the dark.</P>
        <P>The Zodiac craved attention and manipulated the media with a macabre sense of humor. He called into TV shows, claimed responsibility for unsolved crimes, and sent cryptic puzzles that baffled even the FBI.</P>
        <P>At one point, he claimed to have planted a bomb on a school bus. Panic gripped parents across the city, but the bomb was never found. Whether it was a bluff or part of Zodiac’s twisted plan to instill fear, it worked.</P>
        <P>Despite an extensive investigation, Zodiac slipped through the cracks. He was linked to five confirmed murders and two injuries, but his letters suggested far more. The police interviewed hundreds of suspects, including a schoolteacher, a military veteran, and a man named Arthur Leigh Allen, who seemed to match the profile. But no definitive evidence ever tied Allen—or anyone else—to the crimes.</P>
        <P>The Zodiac Killer vanished in the 1970s, leaving behind unanswered questions, shattered families, and a legacy of fear. His ciphers, some still unsolved, remain a haunting reminder of his twisted intellect. Over 50 years later, amateur sleuths and professional detectives alike continue to search for clues, hoping to unmask the shadow that terrorized California.</P>
        <P>As the fog rolls over San Francisco today, it carries with it whispers of a mystery unsolved. Who was the Zodiac Killer? A monster hidden in plain sight, a ghost who reveled in chaos, or simply a man who slipped away, leaving behind a trail of fear and obsession</P>
        <P>The answer remains elusive, locked within the letters, the ciphers, and the mind of a killer who dared the world to catch him—and won.</P>
