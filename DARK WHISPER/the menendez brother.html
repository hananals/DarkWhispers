    <div class="content">
      <p>It was a picture-perfect life—or so it seemed. Lyle and Erik Menendez were the privileged sons of Jose and Kitty Menendez, a wealthy couple living in Beverly Hills. Jose, a self-made business tycoon, ruled the household with an iron fist, while Kitty played the role of the dutiful wife. Beneath the surface of luxury, however, lay a web of secrets, dysfunction, and simmering tension that would explode in one of the most shocking cases in American crime history.</p>
      <P>On the night of August 20, 1989, Beverly Hills police received a frantic 911 call from Erik Menendez. His voice was trembling, barely coherent.
         <br>“Someone killed my parents!”
      </P>
      <P>When officers arrived at the opulent mansion, they were greeted by a grisly scene. Jose and Kitty Menendez had been shot multiple times in their living room, their bodies riddled with shotgun blasts. Jose’s head was nearly blown off, while Kitty’s body showed signs of a desperate attempt to flee. The brutality suggested rage, not robbery.</P>
      <p>The police initially suspected a mafia hit, given Jose’s high-profile business dealings. Meanwhile, the Menendez brothers appeared devastated, crying at their parents’ funeral and retreating from the public eye. But soon, cracks in their story began to show.</p>
      <p>In the weeks following the murders, Lyle and Erik began spending extravagantly. Lyle bought a Porsche, Rolex watches, and a restaurant. Erik hired a tennis coach and traveled the world. Their spending spree totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars, raising eyebrows and suspicion.</p>
      <P>Detectives started looking closer at the brothers. Why would grieving sons spend their inheritance so recklessly? And why had they seemed unusually calm during their initial interviews?</P>
      <P>The breakthrough came when Erik, overwhelmed with guilt, confided in his psychologist, Dr. Jerome Oziel. In tearful sessions, Erik admitted that he and Lyle had murdered their parents. The confession was explosive, and when Lyle discovered Erik’s slip, he threatened the psychologist.</P>
      <p>Dr. Oziel went to the police, providing recorded tapes of Erik’s confessions. With this evidence, the Menendez brothers were arrested in March 1990.</p>
      <p>The trial captivated the nation. Lyle and Erik claimed they had killed their parents out of fear and desperation, alleging years of abuse at the hands of their father. They described Jose as a tyrant, accusing him of physical and sexual abuse, while painting their mother, Kitty, as complicit and emotionally unstable.</p>
      <P>The defense portrayed the brothers as traumatized victims acting in self-defense. The prosecution, however, painted them as greedy, spoiled young men who murdered their parents for money.</P>
      <P>The trials were broadcast on television, with viewers divided between sympathy and outrage. Many questioned whether the alleged abuse justified such brutal violence.</P>
      <p>In 1996, after years of legal battles and two trials, Lyle and Erik Menendez were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Their case became a symbol of the American fascination with wealth, family dysfunction, and the blurred lines between victim and perpetrator.</p>
      <P>The Menendez brothers' story remains one of the most infamous family murders in history. Their case inspired documentaries, TV specials, and even fictional adaptations. Decades later, debates continue: Were they victims who snapped under the weight of abuse, or cold-blooded killers driven by greed?</P>
      <p>Behind prison walls, Lyle and Erik live quiet lives. Both married women while incarcerated and maintain that their actions, while horrific, were born of desperation.</p>
